        Ladakh is the home to numerous natural wonders, but the most precious gift bestowed upon this magical land is
        the Chadar Trek. The trek is all about persistence & survival – of learning to survive in the harsh terrains at
        sub-zero temperatures, interacting with the locals & understanding their way of living, especially in one of the
        most inhabitable regions in the world, while you trek across a dramatic gorge with frozen waterfalls on the
        frozen trail of Zanskar spanned out like a “Chadar” it acts as a mirror for the sky!
